                <h4 class="card-text" style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;">DOHA, Qatar ‚Äî Brazil's problem, in
                    the end, was not so much that Neymar missed his country's second game at the World Cup. Brazil still
                    had plenty of scoring options, after all, arguably more than any other team in the tournament. But
                    the rules of soccer require that the ball actually goes into the net to count, and through 82
                    agonizing and frustrating minutes Brazil's array of attacking talent simply could not make that
                    happen.
                    Richarlison sent a shot wide. Raphinha probed the right side. Vin√≠cius J√∫nior had a goal disallowed
                    for offside. Rodrygo came on, and then so did Bruno Guimaraes and Antony and Gabriel Jesus. Nothing.
                    <br><br>Casemiro's goal, when it finally came, was one to remember. It was off his foot so fast, and
                    was so well-placed, that the Swiss goalkeeper could only watch it pass like a man admiring a bullet
                    train from the platform. But it did the job, which was more than Brazil's forwards could say on
                    Monday.
                    Neymar, who missed Monday's game with a swollen ankle sustained in Brazil's opener, will be back
                    soon enough. When he returns, he will be fortunate to score a goal as good as the one that, on
                    Monday, almost didn't come.

                    here @tim_cook?‚Äù Elon Musk tweeted on Monday to Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, igniting a
                    spat between the world's richest man and the world's most valuable public company.

                    In a series of tweets over 15 minutes, Mr. Musk, the new owner of Twitter, accused Apple of
                    threatening to withhold Twitter from its App Store, a move that would limit some new users from
                    downloading the app. The action would amount to censorship, Mr. Musk said, with no explanation from
                    Apple for why Twitter would be blocked. He added that Apple had also reduced its advertising
                    spending on Twitter.

                    Mr. Musk's purchase of Twitter has upended the relative harmony between it and Apple. As an
                    outspoken user of the platform, with nearly 120 million followers, Mr. Musk has often used Twitter
                    to needle business rivals like Bill Gates or Sam Bankman-Fried. His spat with Mr. Cook could become
                    ‚Äúa revolution against online censorship in America,‚Äù Mr. Musk tweeted on Monday.</h4>

                    Who's to say what prompted his decision to recently blurt out on a livestream that the book‚Äîover a
                    decade in the making‚Äîis roughly 75% done. Maybe Martin forgot he'd told people to shut up and let
                    him finish, because he's been updating people on this book for over a decade now and just can't help

                    he is we can roughly estimate how much longer we need to wait for The Winds of Winter. Maybe he
                    hopes we'll be so distracted by trying to map out that guesstimate we'll give him the time to finish
